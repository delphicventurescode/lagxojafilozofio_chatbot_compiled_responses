# 📸 Samvaad with Prof. Bhaskaran Raman

This folder contains selected screenshots from an ongoing dialogue between myself and Prof. Bhaskaran Raman (IIT Bombay), as part of the **Samvaad** initiative under *La Gxoja Filozofio*.

The screenshots illustrate that **genuine, respectful dialogue** — even with leading technical minds like computer science professors — is not only possible, but enriching.

🗣️ The only personal detail explicitly mentioned is a question I posed to Prof. Raman about his preferred medium of communication (email vs. WhatsApp).

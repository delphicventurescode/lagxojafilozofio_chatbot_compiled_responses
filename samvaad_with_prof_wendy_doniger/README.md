# üì∏ Samvaad with Prof. Wendy Doniger

This folder contains selected screenshots. 

I have been having ongoing dialogues with various academics around the world. I was recently having a "samvaad" with Prof. Wendy Doniger about her coming on to our Talk Series. Our company, IIRC, had been trying to get her to come to a panel discussion series earlier. Not sure if we invited her, but we wanted to invite her again, this time to a Talk Series.

I had wanted to pose to her some of my critiques of her work as questions as part of a "Q and A". She accepted our 
invitation and then later declined it - for reasons that still seem unclear. 

I want to record this as not a "bot conversation screen capture" of the ongoing dialogue between myself and Prof. Wendy Doniger (University of Chicago), as part of the **Samvaad** initiative under *La Gxoja Filozofio*, but rather as an 
example of how respectful dialogue is possible. However, since she has turned down our request, it is also clear that
even if respectful dialogue is possible, the requisite outcome will be what would be socially ideal or ideal for the
individual. Someone who has said or done something controversial or socially suboptimal can simply refuse to come and answer
questions about their work.

The screenshots illustrate that **genuine, respectful dialogue** ‚Äî even with eminent scholars of religion and culture,
even with people with whom we disagree ‚Äî is not only possible, but also a good thing.

üó£Ô∏è The only personal detail, AFAWK, explicitly mentioned so far is a question I posed to Prof. Bhaskaran Raman about his preferred medium of communication for the purposes of discussing the Talk Series we are planning. In fact, after a 
mention about a certain privacy consideration from Prof. Wendy Doniger, we removed an entire Talk from our Talk series.

No boundaries are being crossed, AFAWK.
